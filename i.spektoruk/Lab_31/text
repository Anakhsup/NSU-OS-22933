english text I am a new member of the forum and I want to post a question. I've seen some people who are interested in the use of this program (but no one has posted yet). If anyone knows someone who wants to give it a try, please let me know. If you have a problem with the program, I will try to fix it.
The program is very easy to use. You are asked to insert the following code into your html file:
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.html-to-gif.com/js/tgif.js"></script>
